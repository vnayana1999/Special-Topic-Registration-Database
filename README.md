# Special-Topic-Registration-Database

OBJECTIVE:
The Students of the Computer Science Department of the University pursuing their fourth and sixth semester in engineering have the choice of special topic and mini project. The administration requires the students to provide their choices in order to register them for the specific courses. Our project aims to improve this process by providing a easy user interface for students to register to the specific courses they wish to, as well as implementing the database required to implement the same.

DESCRIPTION:
The special topic registration database keeps track of the student, the professors, the courses offered and the mini projects. The Computer Science Department of the college offers many special topic courses. The special topic is divided into courses and mini project. The courses include Web Frameworks, Fine Techniques, Secured Programming etc. The Student database contains important information such as 

student name (s_name), USN (S_usn), semester in which he/she is studying, email id(S_email) and phone number(S_Phone). The Computer Science department has many courses. Each course has a unique code (C_code), course name (C_name) and course credits (C_cred).
The professors control the special topic courses information and the students can have access to read it and register to the special topic they wish to.

TOOLS USED
HTML and CSS were utilized in designing and structuring the webpages. PHP was used to link the database with the HTML. MySQL was utilized as our database framework.
